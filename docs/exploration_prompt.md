A2A Protocol Documentation and Analysis Task
I am working on a project that requires the use of the Google A2A protocol. This is a very recent protocol and it is not inside your knowledge base. To fix this, I have downloaded three repositories:

The A2A protocol main repository: includes a /docs folder with the definition of the protocol
The A2A Python SDK: the library that we will be using to build the A2A client and servers
The A2A-samples repo: contains a number of use cases on how to use the library
Goal: Use the A2A protocol in a Python project, initially for a CLI interface client.

Task Instructions
You are currently in the {repo_name} repository.

Please explore this repository systematically and gather as much information as possible about the A2A protocol.

Output Requirements
Write a comprehensive documentation file in markdown format that includes:

Core Documentation
Protocol overview and key concepts
API reference extracted from the docs
Authentication patterns and security model
Request/response structures and data formats
Error handling mechanisms
Implementation Guide
Installation and setup instructions
Code examples from the samples repo
SDK structure and main components
Configuration options and environment setup
CLI-Specific Focus
Since we're building a CLI client, prioritize information about:

Command-line interface patterns from samples
Client-side implementation approaches
Authentication flow for CLI applications
Input/output handling and data serialization
Actionable Insights
Include recommendations for:

Which SDK components are most relevant for CLI development
Potential implementation patterns based on the samples
Best practices and important considerations
Any gotchas, limitations, or common pitfalls
Additional Notes
Focus on practical implementation details over theoretical concepts
Extract and include relevant code snippets with explanations
Note any version compatibility requirements
Identify any external dependencies or services required
