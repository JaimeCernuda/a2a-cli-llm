Build A2A CLI Client and Server - Development Task
Context
Primary Objective
Build a simple but functional Python CLI application that demonstrates both A2A client and server functionality, designed as a foundation for future expansion.

Technical Requirements
Project Structure & Management
Use uv as the package management system
Create proper pyproject.toml configuration
Set up the project to support uv run commands for easy execution
Organize code in a modular, extensible structure
Application Components
Build two main components:

1. A2A CLI Client
Command-line interface for interacting with A2A servers
Support basic A2A protocol operations (based on SDK capabilities)
Clean argument parsing and user-friendly output
Error handling and validation
2. A2A CLI Server
Simple server implementation that can respond to A2A protocol requests
Basic endpoint(s) for testing client functionality
Proper logging and error handling
Configurable host/port settings
Implementation Guidelines
Study the three repositories to understand:
Protocol specifications from the main repo docs
SDK usage patterns and best practices
Real-world examples from the samples repo
Follow SDK conventions and recommended patterns
Keep it simple but well-structured for future expansion
Include proper documentation in code comments
Project Setup Requirements
Create a project structure that supports:

bash
# Client operations
uv run client [command] [options]

# Server operations  
uv run server [options]

# Testing
uv run test
Deliverables
1. Working Code
Complete Python project with uv configuration
Functional CLI client with basic commands
Working server that responds to client requests
Proper project structure and organization
2. Testing & Validation
Test the complete system to ensure client-server communication works
Include basic test cases or validation scripts
Demonstrate successful A2A protocol communication
Document any test procedures or validation steps
3. Documentation & Lessons Learned
Create a comprehensive markdown file (DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md) that includes:

Implementation Summary
Overview of what was built and how it works
Key design decisions and rationale
Project structure explanation
Technical Insights
How the A2A protocol works (based on your analysis)
SDK usage patterns and important classes/methods
Authentication and configuration requirements
Development Lessons
Challenges encountered and solutions found
Best practices discovered from the samples
Recommendations for future development
Performance considerations or limitations noted
Usage Instructions
How to set up and run the project
Example commands and expected outputs
Configuration options and customization
Future Expansion Notes
Architecture decisions that support extensibility
Suggested areas for enhancement
Potential integration points or features
Success Criteria
The project should demonstrate:

✅ Successful A2A protocol communication between client and server
✅ Clean, maintainable code structure ready for expansion
✅ Proper uv project setup with working run commands
✅ Comprehensive documentation of the development process
✅ Working test/validation of the complete system
Important Notes
Prioritize functionality over feature completeness
Focus on creating a solid foundation rather than extensive features
Ensure the code is well-commented and self-documenting
If you encounter any limitations or missing information, document them clearly
The goal is a working proof-of-concept that demonstrates A2A protocol usage
